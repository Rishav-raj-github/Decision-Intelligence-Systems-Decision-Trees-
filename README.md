## 🎯 Overview

Welcome to the **Decision Intelligence Systems** repository—your comprehensive guide to mastering tree-based machine learning for 2025 and beyond. This repository bridges the gap between traditional decision trees and cutting-edge explainable AI, providing production-ready implementations for classification, regression, and risk analytics.

Whether you're building credit risk models, fraud detection systems, or healthcare diagnostics, decision trees offer unmatched interpretability without sacrificing performance. This repository takes you from foundational CART algorithms to state-of-the-art gradient boosting frameworks, all while maintaining a focus on **explainability, scalability, and real-world deployment**.
